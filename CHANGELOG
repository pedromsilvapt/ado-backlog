## Unreleased

### Added

 - Added work-item overrides
    ```json
    workItems {
        type "User Story" {
            state "Review Internally" color="#FFFFFF"
            state "Review with Customer" color="#FFFFFF"
        }
    }
    ```
 - Added work-item specific columns for the table of contents. **Note** The number of columns for all work item types must be the same!
    ```json
    value width="90px"  header="State" field="System.State"
    // For the story points, omit the field for Epic and Feature work items, so the column is empty
    value width="60px" header="Story Points" { workItems "Epic" "Feature"; }
    value width="60px" header="Story Points" field="Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints" align="right" { workItems "User Story" "Bug"; }
    value width="200px" header="Value Area" field="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea"
    ```
